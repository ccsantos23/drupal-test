<Title>Button</Title>

A button that tracks the number of clicks using JavaScript. It also supports an
optional icon right next to the button text.

## Usage

Use this component to build other top level components.

## Additional Info

This is not very well suited to map to a _Content Type_. This maps best to a
_field_ that includes a text for the button label.

This was originally from [SDC Examples](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/sdc_examples),
copied here to test Storybook working with Drupal.
